## Microbiome, Atopic Disease, and Prematurity (MAP) Study
Preterm infants are at a higher risk for the development of asthma and atopic disease, resulting in lifelong negative health consequences. This is likely due, in part, to alterations that occur in the gut microbiome and metabolome during their stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Yet, we don’t fully understand the differential role of family history (i.e., maternal asthma diagnosis) and hospital-related clinical factors that might alter microbial exposures early in life. To explore this, we looked at a unique cohort of preterm infants born ≤ 34 weeks gestational age from two local level III neonatal intensive care units, as part of MAP (Microbiome, Atopic disease, and Prematurity) Study.  Weekly stool, milk feeds, and saliva were collected until discharge, and monthly stool and milk samples were collected at home until one year of age. We chose a sub-cohort of infants whose mothers had a history of asthma and matched them to gestational age and sex of infants of mothers without a history of asthma (control). We performed a prospective, paired metagenomic and metabolome analysis of stool and milk feed samples collected at birth, 2 weeks and 6 weeks postnatal age. Here, I report the R code used to analyze the metagenomic data from this study. Raw files and metadata can be accessed in the QIITA repository (Study ID 13241).
