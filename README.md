# MAP
There is increasing recognition that the microbiome may be important in the development of allergic disease. Studies have shown that term infants who later developed asthma showed transient gut microbial dysbiosis during first 3 months of life that was different than healthy infants. Dysbiosis may occur in preterm infants due to their critical condition (i.e. feeding type, antibiotic use, sepsis etc.). However, the specific microbial pattern in allergy-prone preterm infants has not been studied. MAP Study aims to Assess if there is a specific pattern of gut, oral and/or breast milk microbiome over time that is affected by the type of nutrition a preterm baby receives (donor vs maternal vs formula), Assess whether there are patterns in the microbiome associated with the development of allergic sensitization patterns Determine if early patterns of the microbiome and allergic sensitization predict atopy (food allergies, allergic rhinitis, eczema, asthma) by 2 years of age.
